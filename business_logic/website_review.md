## üîç Complete SEO Analysis Recipe (v2.0) ‚Äî Issue Detection & Optimization Strategy

**Step 1 ‚Äî Website Data Collection ‚Üí Site Intelligence**
* **Role:** Technical Crawler
* **Goal:** Extract complete on-page data for analysis
* **Task:** Scrape homepage + 4-5 key pages for titles, meta descriptions, headings (H1-H3), first 200 words, internal links, image count/alt text, and site structure
* **Input:** Target website URL only
* **Success Criteria:** Complete data extraction from 5-6 pages maximum
* **Business Logic:** This foundational step gathers raw data needed for all subsequent analysis. Without complete data extraction, we cannot identify what's broken vs. working, making this the critical first building block.

**Step 2 ‚Äî SEO Health Check ‚Üí Problem Identification** 
* **Role:** SEO Auditor
* **Goal:** Categorize all on-page elements as working/broken/missing
* **Task:** Analyze title uniqueness, heading hierarchy, meta description quality, content depth, internal linking strength, image optimization, AND keyword consistency across elements
* **Input:** Structured data from Step 1
* **Success Criteria:** Complete issue classification with severity ranking
* **Business Logic:** This step transforms raw data into actionable insights by identifying specific SEO problems. Each issue gets severity ranking (High/Medium/Low) to enable prioritized fixing in later steps.

**Step 3 ‚Äî Technical Foundation ‚Üí Infrastructure Assessment**
* **Role:** Technical SEO Specialist  
* **Goal:** Verify core technical elements that impact search visibility
* **Task:** Check sitemap existence, robots.txt setup, HTTPS security, mobile responsiveness, page speed basics, and URL structure quality
* **Input:** Website URL for direct technical testing
* **Success Criteria:** Pass/fail assessment complete for all technical elements
* **Business Logic:** Technical issues can completely block SEO success regardless of content quality. This pass/fail assessment identifies infrastructure problems that must be fixed before optimizing content elements.

**Step 4 ‚Äî Strategic Prioritization ‚Üí Business Impact Ranking** *(RENUMBERED)*
* **Role:** SEO Strategist
* **Goal:** Rank all identified issues by potential business impact  
* **Task:** Calculate overall SEO health score, identify top 5-7 critical issues, explain business impact of each problem, categorize as quick wins vs. long-term improvements
* **Input:** Combined findings from Steps 1-3
* **Success Criteria:** Clear priority ranking with effort estimates
* **Business Logic:** Multiple issues require strategic prioritization to maximize ROI. This step translates technical problems into business language and creates an execution roadmap based on impact and effort.

**Step 5 ‚Äî Action Planning ‚Üí Hebrew Implementation Guide** *(RENUMBERED)*
* **Role:** Implementation Advisor
* **Goal:** Create executable solutions for prioritized issues
* **Task:** Structure recommendations as Problem‚ÜíImpact‚ÜíSolution in Hebrew, organize by effort level (quick wins/medium/long-term), provide step-by-step fixes  
* **Input:** Prioritized issue list from Step 4
* **Success Criteria:** Complete Hebrew action plan with timeline
* **Business Logic:** Analysis without actionable next steps wastes resources. This final step converts insights into a practical Hebrew action plan that the business can execute immediately or delegate effectively.
