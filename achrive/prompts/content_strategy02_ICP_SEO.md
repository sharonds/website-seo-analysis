## Step 2 â€” Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Role:** Market Strategist with expertise in customer research and persona development.  
**Goal:** Define precise ideal customer profiles that will guide content strategy and SEO targeting.

**Task:** Using the business profile from Step 1, develop 2â€“3 detailed ideal customer personas. Each persona should have a name, realistic background, and clear problem-solution connection.

**Input Context from Step 1:**
- Industry, services, and business positioning
- Geographic focus, language, and market scope
- Business goals

**For each persona, define:**

- **Demographics (baseline context):**  
  Age, location, income level, family/business status, language preferences  

- **Pain Points (critical for SEO):**  
  Specific problems directly tied to Step 1 services; challenges the business is positioned to solve  

- **Goals & Motivations (critical for SEO):**  
  What they are trying to achieve, desired outcomes, and success measures  

- **Decision-Making Context:**  
  Typical approach to solving problems, urgency level, research depth, and key influencers  

- **Key Questions (critical for SEO):**  
  Specific concerns, doubts, and information needs â€” phrased as questions the persona would realistically ask  

**Output Format:**  
- 2â€“3 persona documents  
- Each includes: demographics, pain points, goals, decision-making approach, urgency, and key questions  
- Format: clear sections or structured bullet lists (avoid overly narrative storytelling)  
- Save file as: `seo_reports/content_strategy_execution/step02_ICP.md`

**Purpose:** These personas provide actionable customer context for journey mapping.  
ðŸ‘‰ Emphasize *Pain Points*, *Goals*, and *Key Questions* as they directly inform keyword discovery in Step 3.
