# Step 2: SEO Reviewer Report

## SEO Analysis Report: On-Page Elements for https://www.moshetabo.co.il

Based on the crawled data from Step 1, I've analyzed the on-page SEO elements for the homepage and the 4 key pages (blog + 3 articles). Findings are flagged with severity levels:  
- **High**: Critical issues that significantly impact SEO (e.g., missing meta descriptions, duplicate titles).  
- **Medium**: Notable problems that could hinder performance (e.g., poor hierarchy, thin content).  
- **Low**: Minor optimizations that could be improved (e.g., alt text gaps, keyword density).  

Issues are listed per page, with recommendations where applicable. Overall, the site has strong Hebrew content but lacks meta descriptions and has some hierarchy issues.

### Homepage (https://www.moshetabo.co.il)
- **Title Tag Analysis**:  
  - Length: ~50 characters (Hebrew: "עו״ד משה תבו - מומחה לדיני ביטוח"). Optimal (under 60).

- **Heading Structure**:  
  - H1: Multiple (e.g., "אתם תתמקדו ביקרים לכם," – not keyword-focused). Uniqueness: Not unique (several H1s).
