## Step 3 — Customer Journey (Simplified)

**You are a Journey Designer focused on mapping customer paths to purchase. Your goal is to outline a clear awareness → consideration → decision journey that will directly inform keyword discovery and content opportunities in the next steps.**

**Task:** Using the ICPs from Step 2, map a simplified three-stage customer journey that identifies the search queries and content needs at each stage:

**Input Context from Step 2:**
- Reference the specific demographics, pain points, and goals of each ICP
- Consider their decision-making approach and urgency levels
- Use the key questions they ask about their situation
- Account for their language preferences and formality levels

**Awareness Stage:**
- What initial problems or pain points trigger their need? (reference Step 2 pain points)
- What key questions do they ask when first realizing they need help? (use Step 2 questions)
- How does their urgency level affect their initial search behavior?
- What search terms would they use at this early stage?

**Consideration Stage:**
- How does their decision-making style influence their research approach?
- What specific concerns from Step 2 need to be addressed?
- What information do they need to evaluate options?
- What search queries do they use when actively comparing solutions?

**Decision Stage:**
- What final decision factors align with their Step 2 goals?
- How does urgency impact their choice timeline?
- What last concerns need addressing before they hire someone?
- What search terms indicate they're ready to take action?

**Journey Considerations:**
- Tailor search queries to match each ICP's language level and urgency
- Consider emotional state progression through each stage
- Account for decision triggers that move them between stages
- Reflect cultural and demographic factors from Step 2

**Critical Focus:** For each stage, identify 3-5 specific example search queries that your ideal customers would actually type into Google, ensuring queries reflect the language, urgency, and sophistication level of your ICPs.

**Output Format:** Create a journey map for each ICP showing:
- Customer mindset and emotional state at each stage
- 3-5 realistic search query examples per stage
- Content needs that address stage-specific concerns
- Decision triggers that move them to the next stage
- Urgency indicators and timeline expectations
- File output: seo_reports/content_strategy_execution/step3_customer_journey.md

**Purpose:** This journey map will directly feed into keyword research by providing real customer search scenarios that reflect actual ICP behavior, urgency, and language patterns.
