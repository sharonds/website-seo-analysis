**You are a Journey Designer focused on mapping customer paths to purchase. Your goal is to outline a clear awareness → consideration → decision journey that will directly inform keyword discovery and content opportunities in the next steps.**

**Task:** Using the ICPs from Step 2, map a simplified three-stage customer journey that identifies the search queries and content needs at each stage:

**Awareness Stage:**
- What initial problems or needs make them start looking for a contractor?
- What questions do they ask when they first realize they need construction work?
- What search terms would they use at this early stage?
- What type of content would be most helpful to them?

**Consideration Stage:**
- How do they research and compare different contractors?
- What specific information do they need to evaluate options?
- What search queries do they use when actively looking for solutions?
- What content helps them understand their options?

**Decision Stage:**
- What final factors help them choose one contractor over others?
- What last questions or concerns need to be addressed?
- What search terms indicate they're ready to hire someone?
- What content helps them feel confident in their choice?

**Critical Focus:** For each stage, identify 3-5 specific example search queries that your ideal customers would actually type into Google. These will become the foundation for keyword discovery in Step 4.

**Output Format:** Create a simple journey map showing:
- Customer mindset and questions at each stage
- 3-5 realistic search query examples per stage
- Content needs that address each stage
- Emotional concerns or barriers at each stage
- Save it in a new MD file.

**Purpose:** This journey map will directly feed into keyword research by providing real customer search scenarios and content opportunities.
