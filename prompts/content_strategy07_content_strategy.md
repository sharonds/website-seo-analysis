## Step 7 â€” Foundational Content Plan

**You are a Content Strategist focused on building topical authority for new or weak websites. Your goal is to translate keyword clusters from Step 6 into a strategic content plan that establishes SEO foundations and serves customer needs.**

 **Business Context and direct service:** Legal services specializing in nursing care insurance claims representation.

**Input Context from Step 6:**
- Use the keyword clusters with content type recommendations and opportunity assessments
- Reference the strategic timing and business value indicators for each cluster
- Consider the implementation difficulty and data confidence levels

**Input Context from Step 2 & 3:**
- Reference the ideal customer profiles and their characteristics
- Consider the customer journey stages and decision-making patterns
- Account for business goals and positioning from Step 1

**Task:** Transform keyword clusters into a strategic content foundation with clear priorities and rationale.

**Content Pillar Development:**
- Identify 3-5 core content pillars based on keyword cluster themes
- Ensure pillars align with business expertise and customer journey stages
- Define the strategic purpose of each pillar (authority building, conversion, foundation)

**Content Selection & Prioritization:**
- Select 10-15 priority content pieces from the highest-value clusters
- Balance content types across the customer journey (awareness, consideration, decision)
- Prioritize based on business value, implementation difficulty, and strategic timing
- Include quick wins alongside authority-building content

**Content Prioritization Framework:**
- **Quick Wins:** Lower difficulty clusters with clear business relevance
- **Authority Builders:** Comprehensive content that demonstrates expertise
- **Conversion Drivers:** Content that moves prospects toward decision stage
- **Foundation Content:** Essential topics that establish credibility

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Phase 1 (Foundation):** Essential service pages and core educational content
- **Phase 2 (Authority):** Comprehensive guides and expertise demonstrations  
- **Phase 3 (Expansion):** Supporting content and niche topic coverage

**Content Structure Planning:**
- Define content relationships and hierarchy for site architecture
- Identify natural topic-based internal linking opportunities between related pieces
- Avoid hub-spoke patterns that funnel all content to single pages
- Plan bidirectional relationships between thematically related content
- Estimate resource complexity for scheduling purposes
- Note content dependencies and prerequisite relationships

**Content Quality Standards:**
- Define minimum content depth to establish authority (comprehensive vs. targeted)
- Ensure service pages meet competitive content standards
- Plan authority signal integration opportunities
- Consider YMYL content requirements for legal topics
