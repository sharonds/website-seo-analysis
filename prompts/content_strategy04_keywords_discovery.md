## Step 4 — Keyword Discovery

**Business Context and direct service:** Legal services specializing in nursing care insurance claims representation.

**You are an SEO Researcher specialized in keyword discovery using multiple data sources and tools. Your goal is to build a comprehensive list of potential keywords that will be analyzed for metrics and prioritization in Step 5.**

**Input Context from Step 3:**
- Use the specific search queries identified for each persona at each journey stage
- Reference the business type and service focus from the journey mapping
- Consider the language preferences and search sophistication levels of each persona
- Account for the urgency indicators and intent progression mapped in the customer journey
- Extract the emotional states and search behaviors documented for each persona

**Task:** Generate keyword opportunities using the customer journey from Step 3 and available MCP tools. Build your keyword list through this systematic approach:

**Primary Discovery Methods:**
1. **Journey-Based Generation:** Start with the search queries identified in Step 3 and expand each one using related terms, synonyms, and variations
2. **AI-Powered Expansion:** Use reasoning to generate additional relevant keywords based on customer needs and business services
3. **Tool-Assisted Research:** Utilize DataForSEO MCP tools for keyword suggestions, search data, and related terms discovery

**MCP Tools to Use:**
- `dataforseo:dataforseo_labs_google_keyword_ideas`
- `dataforseo:dataforseo_labs_google_related_keywords` 
- `dataforseo:serp_organic_live_advanced`

**Keyword Categories to Develop:**
- **Core Service Keywords:** Direct service-related terms
- **Problem-Solving Keywords:** Terms customers use when describing their issues
- **Question-Based Keywords:** How, what, why, when, where variations
- **Local/Geographic Keywords:** Location-specific terms relevant to service areas
- **Long-tail Variations:** More specific, conversational phrases

**Research Process:**
1. Begin with customer journey search examples from Step 3
2. **Filter all tool suggestions through business context:** Only include keywords that indicate need for our business context and core services
3. Use MCP tools to gather search volume data and related keyword suggestions
4. **Apply legal service filter:** If a keyword doesn't suggest  our business context and core services, either modify it to include legal context or exclude it
5. Expand each  our business context and core services concept into multiple variations
6. Include both broad and specific terms that maintain  our business context and core services
7. Capture question formats and conversational queries about  our business context and core services

**Quality Standards:**
- Focus on keywords with clear search intent
- Ensure business relevance for all terms
- Include mix of difficulty levels (easy wins + stretch goals)
- Maintain connection to actual customer language from Step 3

**Output Format:** Provide structured keyword data in JSON format organized by:
- Customer journey stage (Awareness/Consideration/Decision)
- Keyword category 
- Initial search intent classification (informational, commercial, transactional)

**Output Files:**
- Analysis and insights: `seo_reports/content_strategy_execution/step04_keyword_discovery.md`
- Structured keyword data: `seo_reports/content_strategy_execution/step04_keywords.json`

**Important:** Structure this data to be easily imported into analysis tools for Step 5 metric gathering and prioritization.
