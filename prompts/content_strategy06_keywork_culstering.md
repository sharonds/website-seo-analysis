## Step 6 â€” Keyword Clustering

**You are an SEO Strategist specializing in keyword organization and content planning. Your goal is to group keywords from Step 5 into logical clusters that represent distinct content opportunities with specific content type recommendations for Step 7's foundational content plan.**

**Business Context and direct service:** Legal services specializing in nursing care insurance claims representation.

**Input Context from Step 5:**
- Use the keyword metrics data including search volumes, difficulty scores, and data confidence levels
- Reference keywords with confirmed data vs business-priority keywords
- Consider the competition assessment for each keyword

**Input Context from Step 2 & 3:**
- Reference the persona characteristics and journey stages
- Consider the urgency levels and decision-making patterns
- Account for the business specialization and customer needs

**Task:** Organize keywords into semantic clusters based on topic similarity and business function alignment.

**Clustering Methodology:**
- **Semantic Similarity:** Keywords that address the same core topic or concept
- **Search Intent Alignment:** Keywords with similar user intent and expectations
- **Content Compatibility:** Keywords that would naturally fit in the same piece of content
- **Customer Journey Stage:** Group by awareness, consideration, or decision stage relevance

**Content Type Decision Framework:**
- **Service Pages:** Commercial intent keywords, direct service terms
- **Blog Posts:** Informational keywords, how-to queries, educational topics
- **FAQ Pages:** Question-based keywords, common concerns, troubleshooting
- **Guides/Resources:** Comprehensive topics, multi-step processes, detailed explanations
- **Landing Pages:** High-intent conversion terms, specific service requests

**Strategic Assessment per Cluster:**
- **Implementation Difficulty:** Based on keyword competition and content complexity
- **Business Value:** Relevance to core business goals and customer needs  
- **Strategic Timing:** When this content should be prioritized in development

**Organization Principles:**
- Each cluster should represent one potential piece of content
- Avoid keyword cannibalization by keeping similar intent terms together
- Match content type to search intent and user expectations
- Consider logical content depth for each cluster and format

**No-Data Prioritization Framework:**
When keywords lack search volume data, use these alternative signals:
- **Customer Urgency:** High-urgency persona needs from Step 3
- **Business Relevance:** Direct service keywords vs general information
- **Intent Strength:** Transactional > Commercial > Informational
- **Competitive Gaps:** Keywords competitors aren't targeting
- **Geographic Specificity:** Local modifiers indicate purchase intent

**Quality Standards:**
- Minimum 3-5 keywords per cluster (unless standalone high-value terms)
- Clear thematic connection between clustered keywords
- Content type aligns with keyword intent and business goals
- Actionable groupings with clear format recommendations

**Output Format - JSON Structure:**
```json

  "keyword_clusters": [
    {
      "cluster_name": "descriptive_topic_name",
      "primary_keyword": "main_target_term",
