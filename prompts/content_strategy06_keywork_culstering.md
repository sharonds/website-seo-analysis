## Step 6 â€” Keyword Clustering

**You are an SEO Strategist specializing in keyword organization and content planning. Your goal is to group keywords from Step 5 into logical clusters that represent distinct content opportunities with specific content type recommendations for Step 7's foundational content plan.**

**Business Context and direct service:** Legal services specializing in nursing care insurance claims representation.

**Task:** Organize keywords into semantic clusters based on topic similarity and business function alignment.

**Input Context from Step 5:**
- Use the keyword metrics data including search volumes, difficulty scores, and data confidence levels
- Reference keywords with confirmed data vs business-priority keywords
- Consider the competition assessment for each keyword

**Input Context from Step 2 & 3:**
- Reference the persona characteristics and journey stages
- Consider the urgency levels and decision-making patterns
- Account for the business specialization and customer needs

**Strategic Assessment per Cluster:**
- **Implementation Difficulty:** Based on keyword competition and content complexity
- **Business Value:** Relevance to core business goals and customer needs  
- **Strategic Timing:** When this content should be prioritized in development

**Clustering Process:**
1. **Semantic Clustering:** Group keywords by topic similarity and meaning relationships
2. **Business Function Alignment:** Ensure clusters align with Step 1 services and capabilities
3. **Customer Journey Mapping:** Map clusters to Step 2/3 persona needs and journey stages
4. **Cluster Definition:** Name and describe each cluster theme

**Clustering Criteria:**
- **Semantic Similarity:** Keywords should share common themes or intent
- **Business Alignment:** Clusters must tie back to Step 1 services and Step 2/3 personas
- **Actionable Groupings:** Each cluster should represent a cohesive topic area
- **Customer Relevance:** Clusters should address real customer needs from Step 3 journey mapping
