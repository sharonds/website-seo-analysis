Still have pending feedback from caude on the stet 7 prompt
OK the next step is to build step eight and nine and 10. I also want to improve the site review so we can run it for sarit and moshe.
Run webiste review again with moseh and sarit


 Also, they didn't take into account data from Google Edward Edward using the future we wrote all the prompts but I think we need to review everything about six from six onwards and we need to update the business logic because we broke down phase 4.
