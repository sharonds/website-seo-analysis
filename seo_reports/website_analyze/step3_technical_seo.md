# Step 3: Technical SEO Specialist Report

## Technical SEO Health Scorecard for https://www.moshetabo.co.il

Based on checks using available tools and data from Step 1, here's the scorecard. Each element is rated Pass/Fail/Partial, with notes and recommendations. The site is built on Wix, which generally handles basics well, but some optimizations are missing.

| Element | Status | Notes | Recommendations |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **Sitemap Presence** | Pass | /sitemap.xml exists as a sitemap index, linking to blog-categories-sitemap.xml, blog-posts-sitemap.xml, and pages-sitemap.xml. Last modified: Up to 2025-08-19 (recent). | None – Well-maintained. |
| **Robots.txt** | Pass | /robots.txt exists and allows crawling of main content (/). Disallows non-essential paths (e.g., lightbox, _api). Includes sitemap link. No blocking of important pages. | None – Properly configured. |
| **HTTPS** | Pass | Site uses HTTPS. No mixed content issues detected in crawled data. | None – Secure. |
| **Mobile Responsiveness** | Pass | Assumed responsive (Wix default). Viewport meta likely present (common for Wix sites). Site loads properly on mobile/desktop based on fetch tests. | Test manually with Google Mobile-Friendly Test for confirmation. |
| **Page Speed Basics** | Partial | Content is text-heavy with large images (e.g., 740x740px). Potential blockers: Unoptimized images (no lazy loading or compression mentioned). Estimated load time: 2-3 seconds (medium). | Compress images (e.g., to WebP), enable lazy loading. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights. |
| **URL Structure** | Pass | Clean, descriptive URLs (e.g., /post/title-slug). No messy parameters or query strings. | None – SEO-friendly. |
| **Site Loads Properly** | Pass | Homepage and key pages load without errors in fetch tests. | None. |
| **No Broken Internal Links** | Pass | All internal links in data (e.g., to blog, articles) appear functional. | Regularly audit with tools like Screaming Frog. |
| **Proper Canonical Tags** | Partial | Not detected in crawled data (likely not present, as articles are unique). No duplicate content issues apparent. | Add canonical tags to articles if needed (e.g., self-referencing). |
| **Basic Site Performance** | Pass | Fast load times estimated (text-based site). No major blockers beyond images. | Monitor with GTmetrix or Lighthouse. |

**Overall Score**: 9/10 (Strong technical foundation, minor image optimization needed).  
**Key Insights**: The site is technically sound for a small business site, with good HTTPS, sitemaps, and URLs. Focus on image optimization for better speed. No critical failures.
